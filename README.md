# Weather App 
A friend calls you to hang out, and you want to know the weather in your city quickly. This is why my app is here. This small app lets the user know the essential information about the weather in the city they want. It's simple to use and doesn't require activating location services.

For the technologies used in this app, I chose HTML, CSS, and JS for the front-end, of course. For the back-end, I imported an existing weather API from the OpenWeather website (this is the link if you want more details: https://openweathermap.org/).

Have fun! ðŸ˜‰
