# Weather App 
A friend calls you to hung out, and you want to know the weather how it will be in you're city fastly, this is why my app is here. This small app let the user to know the essential information about weather of the city he wants. It's simple to use and without activating the localisation. For the technoligies used in this app, i choose HTML, CSS and JS for the frontEnd of course. For the backend, i import an existing API weather from Open weather website ( this is the link if you want to have more ideas : https://openweathermap.org/ ). 
Have fun ;)
